This project is inspired by the need to provide a web presence for small
businesses like Fietsateljee Berchem, offering them a platform to reach a wider
audience and improve customer engagement. Fietsateljee Berchem currently doesn't
have a website, and this project seeks to fill that gap. The goal is to create
an online space that reflects the shop's values of personalized service and
trustworthiness.
